                    Closing arguments began Thursday morning in the civil fraud case against Donald Trump and his company, which could cost the former president up to $370 million and bar him from the New York real estate industry in which he made his name.

                <p>
                    Trump was in attendance in state Judge Arthur Engoron’s courtroom for the arguments, but Engoron said Wednesday that Trump could not deliver some of those remarks himself after he refused to agree to refrain from personal attacks during his presentation.

                <p>
                    Entrance to the courtroom was delayed Thursday morning after police responded to a bomb threat at Engoron's home.

                <p>
                    Addressing reporters on his way into the courtroom, Trump denied any wrongdoing and called the case "election interference at the highest level." He said he'd been hoping to speak during closings "to help my lawyers reveal all the defects of this case."
                </p> 
                <p>
                    New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office brought the case alleging Trump and his company had engaged in fraud by overstating the value of his assets and properties in financial documents spanning over a decade, was in the courtroom, as well.
                </p>    
                    <p>
                    Protesters gathered outside the courthouse Thursday morning ahead of the trial, chanting, “Thank you Tish!” and holding a banner that read "No Dictators in the USA."
                </p>  
                 <p>
                    Arguments started shortly after 10 a.m. ET. Trump attorney Chris Kise spoke first and said that during the 44 days of trial testimony, "not one witness said there was fraud or identified a material misstatement" in Trump's financial statements — a claim the AG's office is sure to challenge in their statement.                
                </p>   
                 <p>
                    Kise also said that Trump's net worth was higher than what was listed on financial documents being challenged by the AG's office and that he had relied on his accountants for the information in the documents. Kise also minimized the overall importance of the financial statements, saying they had no impact on the favorable interest rates Trump was able to get from banks he was borrowing from. He said the banks knew Trump and "rolled out the red carpet" for him.
